# Reflection

#### Feedback

Due to circumstances preventing us from attending the peer review session, we arranged a separate meeting with our TA, to recieve feedback on our project. During this meeting, she provided us with personalized feedback on our project, which included the following tips:

- Ensure that all graphs have clear titles and labels for variables, that are relevant for the data story.
- Avoid drawing conclusions in the text that are not supported by the data presented in the graphs.
- Ensure that correlations in the graphs are clearly visible; adjust the scale if necessary.

Following this session, we discussed the feedback with our group and implemented it to our project.

#### Self reflection

If the project had extended further, we would have aimed for a broader scope, that is, more cities per country, to achieve greater clarity regarding the correlations discovered. Furthermore, our efforts would have expanded to delve deeper into defining well-being/happiness, enabling us to address a wider array of factors. This approach would have expanded our understanding and provided a more complete analysis of the subject matter.
