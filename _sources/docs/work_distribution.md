# Work distribution

Our way of communicating during the project consisted of following the lectures (werkgroepen). Outside of this, we also had regular meetings, calls and discussed progress through text. To start with, we chose a topic for our project that appealed to all of us, and then started looking for datasets with this in mind. We then cleaned up and merged the datasets we found. However, during the project we came across other subsets that would be very relevant to our research so we added them to our dataset as well. For more information see: (link to dataset and preprocessing). After this, we discussed which graphs would best suit our research and then started developing them. Using the graphs and a story in mind, we then started writing the story. Finally, we dealt with the formatting of the graphs and the text, using the feedback given to us by our TA.

## Ties Hoenderdos

Ties was mainly responsible for creating the graphs. Also, he was responsible for cleaning and merging the various datasets. He participated in the making of the graphs and their associated captions, as well as coming up with the overal design of the project.

## Liza Borman

Liza was responsible for finding datasets and explaining graphs in the datastory. She also looked into several papers to support the main storyline.

## Aimée Oyevaar

Aimée was responsible for finding the datasets to form and improve the main storyline and also helped improving the graphs. Furthermore, she looked found several scientific studies that nourish the perspectives. During the project she continued to assist on the storyline and improving the graphs.

## Hylke Wierda

Hylke was also involved in improving the graphs and creating the basis of the storyline. Furthermore, he looked into several research papers that support the perspectives and continued to assist on the storyline and the graphs during the project.
